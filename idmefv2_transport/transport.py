        This method is responsible for initializing the transport layer.
        It MAY load and initialize additionnal resources/dependencies,
        set this layer's settings to their default values, allocate buffers, etc.

        @param url:
            URL to use to initialize the transport layer.

            The implementing class MUST raise an exception if the given URL
            does not specify a scheme or the specified scheme is not supported
            by this transport layer.

        @param queue:
            An optional instance of {queue.Queue} (or one of its subclasses)
            where received IDMEFv2 messages will be pushed.

            Note:   Checking for the presence of new IDMEF messages does not
                    start until the start() method is called.
                    The check is performed until the stop() method is called.
                    It can then be reenabled by calling the start() method
                    once again.

        @param content_type:
            If specified, the IDMEFv2 messages will be serialized to the
            given MIME content type before being sent.
            Otherwise, a default serialization mechanism will be selected
            automatically by the transport.

            Note:   This parameter only controls the content type of messages
                    being sent by this transport. If this transport is used
                    to receive IDMEFv2 message, any content type can be used
                    as long as a compatible serializer exists.

        This method MUST raise an exception in case a new transport layer
        cannot be created using the provided URL (e.g. because the URL was
        invalid, the URL's scheme is not supported, the URL lacked some kind
        of information, due to the lack of a required resource, ...).

        This method MUST raise an exception when a {content_type} is specified
        which cannot be used (e.g. because it is invalid or no serializer
        supporting that MIME type is available).

                until the start() method is called.
